# Freedif Mirrors
In case of issues with the mirrors, please raise an issue ticket.
Same if you want me to host new projects.

## 2 locations:
1. Germany: de.freedif.org (1GBPS)
2. Singapore: mirror.freedif.org (1GBPS)

I have the possibility to enable one mirror in France (OVH) and one in Finland (Hetzner),
But I'm principally focusing on Singapore, as usually being less covered in term of mirrors.

## Current projects being supported:
- Artix
- Deepin
- EndeavourOS
- fdroid
- Garuda
- GNU
- GNU-Al
- GNU-Sa
- KaOS
- KDE
- lineageos
- LinuxLiteOS
- LinuxMint
- Manjaro
- MXLinux
- osmc
- Parabola
- PCLinuxOS
- Raspbian
- Rocky
- Salix
- Tails
- TDF
- TorProject
- zorin

## Statistics
I use GoAccess to read the log (anonymized) and track various statistics

Full detail here: https://mirror.freedif.org/Stats/Combined.html

## Next steps
- [x] Add rsync script used
- [ ] Add statistics script / detail (GoAccess, Vhost, Logs)
- [ ] Structure demand request (Issue ticket to add a project on one of the servers)

Enjoy
